It's more of a memo than a README, but...

- I'm trying to develop a (very) small service related to maps. Before generating test data, I designed the DB schema considering **Google Maps Platform**'s [Places API](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/places/web-service/details).
- To be honest, in the middle of it, I thought, 'Was it really necessary to cover items unrelated to the service?', so I roughly finished it.
- I think the directory structure will change a lot when I start developing the service, but I'll upload this first.

I should have looked a little more and started working on it. It's a hassle to fix it, so I'm going to leave it as is for now.
